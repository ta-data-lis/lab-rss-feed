As I noted in <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ai-and-machine-learning-will-require-retraining-your-entire-organization\">a recent article</a>, adopting and sustaining AI and machine learning within a company will require retraining your entire organization.

In fact, of the top 20 most-consumed Python titles on O’Reilly Online Learning in 2019, several were focused mainly on data science and machine learning applications, including:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653/\">Python for Data Analysis, 2nd Edition</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/introduction-to-machine/9781449369880/\">Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-finance/9781492024323/\">Python for Finance, 2nd Edition</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/machine-learning-with/9781491989371/\">Machine Learning with Python Cookbook</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp\">survey</a> we conducted earlier this year about AI adoption in the enterprise, respondents cited culture, organization, and lack of skilled people among the leading reasons holding back their adoption of AI technologies. As I noted in <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ai-and-machine-learning-will-require-retraining-your-entire-organization\">a recent article</a>, adopting and sustaining AI and machine learning within a company will require retraining your entire organization. To succeed in implementing and incorporating AI and machine learning technologies, companies need to take a more holistic approach toward retraining their workforces. The rapid growth in consumption of content in training-relevant topics on oreilly.com (including machine learning, data engineering, data science, and AI) provide early signs that companies and individuals are taking training seriously.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>At our upcoming <a href=\"http://theaiconf.com\">Artificial Intelligence conferences</a> in <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca\">San Jose</a> and <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-eu\">London</a>, we have assembled a roster of two-day training sessions, tutorial sessions, and presentations to help individuals (across job roles and functions) sharpen their skills and understanding of AI and machine learning. In addition to our usual strong slate of technical training, tutorials, and talks, we return with a two-day <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/topic/3035\">Business Summit</a> designed specifically for executives and business leaders. Wholesale transformation will require cross-functional teams who are familiar with digital, data, and AI technologies. With this in mind, the AI conference in <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca\">San Jose</a> also will feature several outstanding new tutorials as well as executive briefings and case studies from leading companies and research organizations.</p>\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/how-organizations-are-sharpening-their-skills-to-better-understand-and-use-ai\">How organizations are sharpening their skills to better understand and use AI.</a></p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/Ze7Lt-ShZ8M\" width=\"1\" />',\n",

Yesterday, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/congress-puts-big-tech-in-crosshairs-11563311754\">a US subcommittee on antitrust</a> grilled representatives from Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple in Congress, and presidential candidates have gone so far as to suggest that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/08/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon-google-facebook/index.html\">these behemoths should be broken up</a>. In the European Union, regulation is already happening: in March, the EU levied its <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/business/google-fine-advertising.html\">third multibillion-dollar fine against Google</a>for anti-competitive behavior.</p>\\n<p>In <a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/2018-letter-to-shareholders\">his 2018 letter to shareholders</a>, published this past April, Jeff Bezos was already prepping for conversations with regulators. He doesn’t think Amazon is a monopoly. Instead, the company’s founder argues it is “just a small player in global retail.”</p>\\n<p>In Bezos’s defense, for many of the products Amazon sells, there are indeed many alternative sources, suggesting plenty of competition. Despite Amazon’s leadership in online retail, <a href=\"https://mgmresearch.com/amazon-vs-walmart-revenues-and-profits-comparison-1999-2018/\">Walmart is more than double Amazon’s size </a>as a general retailer, with Costco not far behind Amazon. Specialty retailers like Walgreens and CVS in the pharmacy world and Kroger and Albertson’s in groceries also dwarf Amazon’s presence in their categories.</p>\\n<p>But Amazon does not just compete with Walmart, CVS, Kroger, and other retailers—it also competes with the merchants who sell products through its platform.</p>\\n<p>This competition isn’t just the obvious kind, such as the Amazon Basics-branded batteries that by 2016 represented <a href=\"https://www.1010data.com/company/blog/market-insights-series-amazon-s-advance-the-battle-of-batteries/\">one third of all online battery sales</a>, as well as similar Amazon products in audio, home electronics, baby wipes, bed sheets, and kitchenware. Amazon also competes with its merchants for visibility on its platform, and charges them additional fees for favored placement. And because Amazon is now leading with featured products rather than those its customers think are the best, its merchants are incentivized to advertise on the platform. Amazon’s fast-growing advertising business is thus a kind of tax on its merchants.</p>\\n<p>Likewise, Google does not just compete with other search engines like Bing and DuckDuckGo, but with everyone who produces content on the world wide web. Apple’s iPhone and Google’s Android don’t just compete with each other as smartphone platforms, but also with the app vendors who rely on smartphones to sell their products.</p>\\n<p>This kind of competition is taken for granted by antitrust regulators, who are generally more concerned with the end cost for consumers. And as anyone who has shopped online will know, Amazon is nearly always the cheaper option. (In fact, surveys have suggested that between <a href=\"https://marketingland.com/online-shoppers-use-amazon-to-compare-products-259139\">seven</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/27/amazon-is-the-first-place-most-online-shoppers-visit.html\">nine</a> out of 10 Americans will check Amazon to compare the price of a purchase.) As long as the monopoly doesn’t lead to us forking out more money, then antitrust regulators traditionally leave it alone.</p>\\n<p>However, this view of antitrust leaves out some unique characteristics of digital platforms and marketplaces. These giants don’t just compete on the basis of product quality and price—they control the market through the algorithms and design features that decide which products users will see and be able to choose from. And these choices are not always in consumers’ best interests.</p>\\n<h2>A fresh approach to antitrust</h2>\\n<p>All of the internet giants—Amazon, Google, Facebook, and insofar as app stores are considered, Apple—provide the illusion of free markets, in which billions of consumers choose among millions of suppliers’ offerings, which compete on the basis of price, quality, and availability.</p>\\n<p>But if you recognize that what consumers really choose from is not the universe of all possible products, but those that are offered up to them either on the homepage or the search screen, the “shelf space” provided by these platforms is in fact far more limited than the tiniest of local markets—and what is placed on that shelf is uniquely under the control of the platform owner. And with mobile playing a larger and larger role, that digital shelf space is visibly shrinking rather than growing.</p>\\n<p>In short, the designers of marketplace-platform algorithms and screen layouts can arbitrarily allocate value to whom they choose. The marketplace is designed and controlled by its owners, and that design shapes “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Who-Gets-What-Why-Matchmaking/dp/0544705289\">who gets what and why</a>” (to use the marvelous phrase from Alvin E. Roth, who received a Nobel prize in economics for his foundational work in the field of market design.)</p>\\n\\n<p>When it comes to antitrust, the question of market power must be answered by analyzing the effect of these marketplace designs on both buyers and sellers, and how they change over time. How much of the value goes to the platform, how much to consumers, and how much to suppliers?</p>\\n<p>The platforms have the power to take advantage of either side of their marketplace. Any abuse of market power is likely to show up first on the supply side. A dominant platform can squeeze its suppliers while continuing to pass along part of the benefit to consumers—but keeping more and more of it for themselves.</p>\\n<p>Over time, though, consumers feel the bite. Power over sellers ultimately translates into power over customers as well. As the platform owner favors its own offerings over those of its suppliers, choice is reduced, though it is only in the endgame that consumer pricing—the typical measure of a monopoly—begins to be affected.</p>\\n<p>The control that the platforms have over placement and visibility puts them in a unique position to collect what economists call <em>rents</em>: that is, value extracted through the ownership of a limited resource. These rents may come in the form of additional advantage given to the marketplace’s own private-label products, but also through the fees that are paid by merchants who sell through that platform. These fees can take many forms, including the necessity for merchants to spend more on advertising in order to gain visibility; Amazon products don’t have to pay such a levy.</p>\\n<p>The term “rents” dates back to the very earliest days of modern economics, when agricultural land was still the primary source of wealth. That land was worked productively by tenant farmers, who produced value through their labor. But the bulk of the benefit was taken by the landed gentry, who lived lives of ease on the unearned income that accrued to them simply through the ownership of their vast estates. In today’s parlance, Amazon’s merchants are becoming sharecroppers. The cotton field has been replaced by a search field.</p>\\n<p>Not all rents are bad. Economist Joseph Schumpeter pointed out that technological innovation often can lead to temporary rents, as innovators initially have a corner on a new product or service. But he also pointed out that these so-called Schumpeterian rents can, over time, become traditional monopolistic rents.</p>\\n<p>This is what antitrust regulators should be looking at when evaluating internet platform monopolies. Has control over the algorithms and designs that allocate attention become the latest tool in the landlord’s toolbox?</p>\\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">Big Tech has become the internet’s landlord—and rents are rising as a result.</blockquote>\\n<p>In her book, <a href=\"https://marianamazzucato.com/publications/books/value-of-everything/\"><em>The Value of Everything</em></a>, economist Mariana Mazzucato makes the case that if we are really to understand the sources of inequality in our economy, economists must turn their attention back to rents. One of the central questions of classical economics was what activities are actually creating value for society, and which are merely value extracting—in effect charging a kind of tax on value that has actually been created elsewhere.</p>\\n<p>In today’s neoclassical economics, rents are seen as a temporary aberration, the result of market defects that will disappear given sufficient competition. But whether we are asking fundamental questions about value creation, or merely insufficient competition, rent extraction gives us a new lens through which to consider antitrust policy.</p>\\n<h2>How internet platforms increase choice</h2>\\n<p>Before digital marketplaces curtailed our choices as consumers, they first expanded our options.</p>\\n<p>Amazon’s virtually unlimited virtual shelf space radically expanded opportunity for both suppliers and consumers. After all, <a href=\"https://www.scrapehero.com/number-of-products-on-amazon-april-2019/\">Amazon carries 120 million unique products</a> in the US alone, compared to about 120,000 in a Walmart superstore or 35 million on walmart.com. What’s more, Amazon operates a marketplace with <a href=\"https://www.marketplacepulse.com/amazon/number-of-sellers\">over 2.5 million third-party sellers</a>, whose products, collectively, <a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/2018-letter-to-shareholders\">provide 58% of all Amazon retail revenue</a>, with only 42% coming from Amazon’s first-party retail operation.</p>\\n<p>In the first-party retail operation, Amazon buys products from its suppliers and then resells them to consumers. In the third-party operation, Amazon collects fees for providing marketplace services to sellers—including display on amazon.com, warehousing, shipping, and sometimes even financing—but never legally takes possession of the companies’ merchandise. This is what allows it to have so many more products to sell than its competitors: because Amazon never takes possession of inventory but instead charges suppliers for the services it provides, the risk of offering a slow-moving product is transferred from Amazon to its suppliers.</p>\\n<p>All of this appears to add up to the closest approximation ever seen in retail to what economists call “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition\">perfect competition</a>.” This term refers to market conditions in which a large number of sellers with offers to provide comparable products at a range of prices are met by a large number of buyers looking for those products. Those buyers are armed not only with the ability to compare the price at which products are offered, but also to compare the quality of those products via consumer ratings and reviews. In order to win the business of consumers, suppliers must not only offer the best products at the best prices, but must compete for customers to express their satisfaction with the products they have bought.</p>\\n<p>So far, at least according to the statistics Bezos shared in his annual letter, the success of the Amazon marketplace is a triumph for both suppliers and consumers, and antitrust regulators should look elsewhere. As he put it, “Third-party sellers are kicking our first-party butt.”</p>\\n<p>He may well be right, but there are warning signs from other internet marketplaces like Google search that suggest the situation may not be as rosy as it appears. As it turns out, regulators need to consider some additional factors in order to understand the market power of internet platforms.</p>\\n<h2>How internet platforms take away choice</h2>\\n<p>If Amazon has become “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Store-Jeff-Bezos-Amazon-ebook/dp/B00BWQW73E\">the everything store</a>” for physical goods, Google is the everything store for information.</p>\\n<p>Even more than Amazon, Google appears to meet the conditions for perfect competition. It matches up consumers with a near-infinite source of supply. Ask any question, and you’ll be provided with answers from hundreds or even thousands of competing content suppliers.</p>\\n<p>To do this, Google <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/\">searches hundreds of billions of web pages</a> created by hundreds of millions of information suppliers. Traditional price matching is absent, since much of the content is offered for free, but Google uses hundreds of other signals to determine what answers its customers are likely to find “best.” They measure such things as the reputation of the sites linking to any other site (page rank); the words those sites use to make those links (anchor text); the content of the document itself (via an AI engine referred to as “the Google Brain”); how likely people are to click on a given result in the list, based on millions of iterations, all recorded and measured; and even whether people clicked on a link and appear to have gone away satisfied (“a long click”) or came back and clicked on another (“a short click”).</p>\\n<p>The same goes for advertising on Google. Its <a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/articles/what-is-google-adwords\">“pay per click” ad auction model</a> was a breakthrough in the direction of perfect competition: advertisers pay only when customers click on their ads. Both Google and advertisers are thus incentivized to feature ads that users actually want to see.</p>\\n<p>Only about 6% of Google search results pages contain any advertising at all. Both content producers and consumers have the benefit of Google’s immense effort to index and search all web pages, not just those that are commercially valuable. Google is like a store where all of the goods are free to consumers, but some merchants pay, in the form of advertising, to have their goods placed front and center.</p>\\n<p>The company is well aware of the risk that advertising will lead Google to favor the needs of advertisers over those of searchers. In fact, “Advertising and mixed motives” is the title of the appendix to Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin’s <a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html\">original 1998 research paper on Google’s search algorithms</a>, written while they were still graduate students at Stanford.</p>\\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">By placement on the screen and algorithmic priority, platforms have the power to shape the pages users click on and the products they decide to buy.</blockquote>\\n<p>“The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users,” they thoughtfully observed. Google made enormous efforts to overcome those mixed motives by clearly separating their advertising results from their organic results, but the company has blurred those boundaries over time, perhaps without even recognizing the extent to which they have done so.</p>\\n<p>It is undeniable that the Google search results pages of today look nothing like they did when the company went public in 2004. The list of 10 “organic” results with three paid listings on the top and a sidebar of advertising results on the right that once characterized Google are long gone.</p>\\n<p>Dutch search engine consultant <a href=\"https://www.edwords.nl/2014/04/27/steeds-meer-ruimte-adwords-ten-koste-van-seo/\">Eduard Blacquière documented the changes in size and placement of adwords</a> (link in Dutch), the pay-per-click advertisements that run alongside searches, between 2010 and 2014. Here’s a page he captured in June 2010, the result for a search for the word “autoverzekering” (“auto insurance” in Dutch).</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-32ri8\"><img alt=\"changes in size and placement of adwords\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Tim_1-3aeefcf98cbec1e7ea37b5dc377ba885.jpg\" /><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>Screengrab: Eduard Blacquière.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n<p>Note that the adwords at the top of the page have a background tint, and those at the side have a narrower column width, setting both off clearly from the organic results. Take a quick glance at this page, and your eye can quickly jump to the organic results while ignoring the ads if that’s what you prefer.</p>\\n<p>Here is Blacquière’s dramatization of the change in size of that top block of adwords. As you can see, the ad block has both dramatically changed in size and lost its background color between 2010 and 2019, making it much harder to distinguish ads from organic results.</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-3gKia\"><img alt=\"harder to distinguish ads from organic results\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Tim_2-ad3bed58be86978fd712e233fa30b1ab.jpg\" /><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 2. </span>Screengrab: Eduard Blacquière.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n<p>Today, paid results can push organic results almost off the screen, so that the searcher has to scroll down to see them at all. On mobile pages with advertisements, this is almost always the case. Blacquière also documented the result of several studies done over a five-year period, which found the likelihood of a click on the first organic search result fell from over 40% in 2010 to less than 20% in 2014. This shows that through changes in homepage design alone, Google was able to shift significant attention from organic search results to ads.</p>\\n<p>Not only is paid advertising supplanting organic search results, but for more and more queries, Google itself has now collected enough information to provide what it considers to be the best answer directly to the consumer, eradicating the need to send us to a third-party website at all.</p>\\n<p>That’s the box that often appears above the search results when you ask a question, such as <em>What are the lyrics to “Don’t Stop Believing,”</em> or <em>What date did WWII end?; </em>the box to the right that pops up with restaurant reviews and opening hours; or a series of visual cards midway down the screen that show you the actors who appeared in a movie or different kinds of pastries common to a geographic region.</p>\\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">Through changes in homepage design alone, Google was able to shift significant attention from organic search results to ads.</blockquote>\\n<p>Where does this information come from? In 2010, with <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/deeper-understanding-with-metaweb.html\">the acquisition of Metaweb</a>, Google committed to a project it called “the knowledge graph,” a collection of facts about well-known entities such as places, people, and events. This knowledge graph provides immediate answers for many of the most common queries.</p>\\n<p>The knowledge graph was initially culled from the web by ingesting information from sources such as Wikipedia, Wikidata, and the CIA Factbook, but since then, it has become far more encyclopedic and has ingested information from all over the web. In 2016, Google CEO Sundar Pichai claimed that the Google knowledge graph contained more than 70 billion facts.</p>\\n<p>As shown in the figure below, for a popular search that has commercial potential, like <em>visit Yellowstone</em>, not only is the search results page dominated by paid search results (ads) and content directly supplied by Google, but Google’s “answer boxes” are themselves filled with links to other Google pages rather than to third-party websites. (Note that Google personalizes results and also runs hundreds of thousands of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\">A/B tests</a> a day on the effect of minor changes in position, so your own results for this identical search may have different results than are shown here.)</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-8jiEn\"><img alt=\"google search results\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Tim_3-fb67a3cd5204ae994f4ab9c004966fb4.png\" /><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 3. </span>Screengrab: Tim O\\'Reilly.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n<p>As of March 2017, user clickstream data provided by web analytics firm Jumpshot suggests that <a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/state-of-searcher-behavior-revealed\">up to 40% of all Google queries no longer result in a click through to an external website</a>. Think of all the questions you go to Google for that no longer require a second click: what’s the weather? What’s the current value of the euro against the dollar? What’s that song that’s playing in the background? What’s the best local restaurant? Biographies of eminent people, descriptions of cities, neighborhoods, businesses, historical events, quotes by famous authors, song lyrics, stock prices, and flight times all now appear as immediate answers from Google.</p>\\n<p>I am not necessarily suggesting anti-competitive intent. Google claims, with considerable justice, that all of these changes to search engine result pages are designed to improve user experience. And indeed, it is often helpful to get an immediate answer to a query rather than having to click through to another web site. Furthermore, much of this data is in fact licensed. But these deals seem like a step backward from the perfect competition represented by Google’s original reliance on multi-factor search algorithms to surface the very best information from independent web sites.</p>\\n<p>The net effect on Google’s financial performance is striking. In 2004, the year that Google went public, it had two principal advertising revenue engines: Adwords (those pay-per-click advertisements that run alongside searches on Google’s own site) and Adsense (pay-per-click advertisements that Google places on third-party websites on their behalf, either in search results on their site or directly alongside their content). In 2004, the two revenue sources were very close to equal. But by 2018, Google’s revenue from advertising on its own properties <a href=\"https://qz.com/1540608/the-problem-with-silicon-valleys-obsession-with-blitzscaling-growth/\">had grown to 82% of its total advertising revenue, with only 18% coming from the advertising it provides on third–party sites</a>.</p>\\n<p>These examples illustrate the power of a platform to shape, both by placement on the screen and algorithmic priority, the pages users click on and the products they decide to buy—and therefore also the economic success for the supply side of its marketplace. Google maintains a rigorous separation between the search and advertising teams, but despite that fact, changes in the layout of Google’s pages and its algorithms have played an enormous role in shaping the attention of its users to favor those who advertise with Google.</p>\\n<p>When Google decides unilaterally on the size and position that its own products take on the screen, it also stops consumers from organically deciding what content to click on or what socks to buy. That’s what antitrust regulators should be considering: whether the algorithmic and design control exerted by sites like Google or Amazon reduces the choices we have as consumers.</p>\\n<h2>Maintaining the illusion of choice</h2>\\n<p>If Google has monopolized our access to information, Amazon’s fast-growing advertising business is now shaping what products consumers are actually given to choose from. Have they, too, taken a bite from the poisoned apple of advertising’s mixed motives?</p>\\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">Amazon’s merchants are becoming sharecroppers. The cotton field has been replaced by a search field.</blockquote>\\n<p>Like Google, Amazon used to rely heavily on the collective intelligence of its users to recommend the best products from its suppliers. It did this by using information such as the supplier-provided description of the product, the number and quality of reviews, the number of inbound links, the sales rank of similar products, and so on, to determine the order in which search results would appear. These were all factored into Amazon’s default search ranking, which put products that were considered “Most Popular” first.</p>\\n<p>But as with Google, this eden of internet collective intelligence may be in danger of coming to an end.</p>\\n<p>In the example below, you can see that the default search for “best science fiction books” on Amazon now turns up only “Featured” (i.e., paid for) products. Are these the results you’d expect from this search? Where are the Hugo and Nebula award winners? Where are the books and authors with thousands of five-star reviews?</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-LDibA\"><img alt=\"default search results\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Tim_4-669745af115a715eac3f72debc36432b.png\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n<p>Contrast these results for those for the same search on Google, shown in the figure below. A knowledgeable science-fiction fan might quibble with some of these selections, but this is indeed a list of widely acknowledged classics in the field. In this case, Google presents no advertising, and so the results instead simply reflect the collective intelligence of what the web thinks is best.</p>\\n<p>While this might be taken as a reflection of the superiority of Google’s search algorithms over Amazon’s, the more important point is to note how differently a platform treats results when it has no particular commercial axe to grind.</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-eQiAn\"><img alt=\"how differently a platform treats results when it has no particular commercial axe to grind\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Tim_5-43fd641ca4d9e3970ba558ff5365ce89.png\" /></figure>\\n\\n<p>Amazon has long claimed that the company is <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/greg-satell/the-secret-behind-amazons-uncanny-ability-to-out-innovate-just-about-every-other-company-on-planet.html\">fanatically focused on the needs of its customers</a>. A search like the one shown above, which favors paid results, demonstrates how far the quest for advertising dollars takes them from that avowed goal.</p>\\n<h2>Advice for antitrust regulators</h2>\\n<p>So, how are we therefore best to decide if these Big Tech platforms need to be regulated?</p>\\n<p>In one famous exchange, Bill Gates, the founder and former CEO of Microsoft, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/\">told Chamath Palihapitiya</a>, the one-time head of the Facebook platform:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“This isn’t a platform. A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it exceeds the value of the company that creates it. Then it’s a platform.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Given this understanding of the role of a platform, regulators should be looking to measure whether companies like Amazon or Google are continuing to provide opportunity for their ecosystem of suppliers, or if they’re increasing their own returns at the expense of that ecosystem.</p>\\n<p>Rather than just asking whether consumers benefit in the short term from the companies’ actions, regulators should be looking at the long-term health of the marketplace of suppliers—they are the real source of that consumer benefit, not the platforms alone. Have Amazon, Apple, or Google <em>earned</em> their profits, or are they coming from monopolistic rents?</p>\\n<p>How might we know whether a company operating an algorithmically managed marketplace is extracting rents rather than simply taking a reasonable cut for the services it provides? The first sign may not be that it is raising prices for consumers, but that it is taking a larger percentage from its suppliers, or competing unfairly with them.</p>\\n<p>Before antitrust authorities look to remedies like breaking up these companies, a good first step would be to require disclosure of information about the growth and health of the supply side of their marketplaces. The statistics about the growth of its third-party marketplace that Bezos trumpeted in his shareholder letter tell only half the story. The questions to ask are who profits, by how much, and how that allocation of rewards is changing over time.</p>\\n<p>Regulators such as the SEC should require regular financial reporting on the allocation of value between the platform and its marketplace. I have done limited analysis for Google and Amazon based on information provided in their annual public filings, but much of the information required for a rigorous analysis is just not available.</p>\\n<p>Google provides an annual economic impact report analyzing value provided to its advertisers, but there is no comparable report for the value created for its content suppliers. Nor is there any visibility into the changing fortunes of app suppliers into the Play Store, Google’s Android app marketplace, or into the fortunes of content providers on YouTube.</p>\\n<p>Questions of who gets what and why must be asked of Amazon’s marketplace and its other operating units, <a href=\"https://onezero.medium.com/open-source-betrayed-industry-leaders-accuse-amazon-of-playing-a-rigged-game-with-aws-67177bc748b7\">including its dominant cloud-computing division</a>, or Apple’s App Store. The role of Facebook’s algorithms in deciding what content appears in its readers’ newsfeeds has been widely scrutinized with regard to political bias and manipulation by hostile actors, but there’s been little rigorous economic analysis of <em>economic bias</em> in the algorithms of any of these companies.</p>\\n<p>Data is the currency of these companies. It should also be the currency of those looking to regulate them. You cannot regulate what you don’t understand. The algorithms that these companies use may be defended as trade secrets, but their outcomes should be open to inspection.</p>\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/antitrust-regulators-are-using-the-wrong-tools-to-break-up-big-tech\">Antitrust regulators are using the wrong tools to break up Big Tech.</a></p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/LKjkCKA4W2s\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

Yesterday, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/congress-puts-big-tech-in-crosshairs-11563311754\">a US subcommittee on antitrust</a> grilled representatives from Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple in Congress, and presidential candidates have gone so far as to suggest that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/08/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon-google-facebook/index.html\">these behemoths should be broken up</a>. In the European Union, regulation is already happening: in March, the EU levied its <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/business/google-fine-advertising.html\">third multibillion-dollar fine against Google</a>for anti-competitive behavior.</p>\\n<p>In <a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/2018-letter-to-shareholders\">his 2018 letter to shareholders</a>, published this past April, Jeff Bezos was already prepping for conversations with regulators. He doesn’t think Amazon is a monopoly. Instead, the company’s founder argues it is “just a small player in global retail.”</p>\\n<p>In Bezos’s defense, for many of the products Amazon sells, there are indeed many alternative sources, suggesting plenty of competition. Despite Amazon’s leadership in online retail, <a href=\"https://mgmresearch.com/amazon-vs-walmart-revenues-and-profits-comparison-1999-2018/\">Walmart is more than double Amazon’s size </a>as a general retailer, with Costco not far behind Amazon. Specialty retailers like Walgreens and CVS in the pharmacy world and Kroger and Albertson’s in groceries also dwarf Amazon’s presence in their categories.</p>\\n<p>But Amazon does not just compete with Walmart, CVS, Kroger, and other retailers—it also competes with the merchants who sell products through its platform.</p>\\n<p>This competition isn’t just the obvious kind, such as the Amazon Basics-branded batteries that by 2016 represented <a href=\"https://www.1010data.com/company/blog/market-insights-series-amazon-s-advance-the-battle-of-batteries/\">one third of all online battery sales</a>, as well as similar Amazon products in audio, home electronics, baby wipes, bed sheets, and kitchenware. Amazon also competes with its merchants for visibility on its platform, and charges them additional fees for favored placement. And because Amazon is now leading with featured products rather than those its customers think are the best, its merchants are incentivized to advertise on the platform. Amazon’s fast-growing advertising business is thus a kind of tax on its merchants.</p>\\n<p>Likewise, Google does not just compete with other search engines like Bing and DuckDuckGo, but with everyone who produces content on the world wide web. Apple’s iPhone and Google’s Android don’t just compete with each other as smartphone platforms, but also with the app vendors who rely on smartphones to sell their products.</p>\\n<p>This kind of competition is taken for granted by antitrust regulators, who are generally more concerned with the end cost for consumers. And as anyone who has shopped online will know, Amazon is nearly always the cheaper option. (In fact, surveys have suggested that between <a href=\"https://marketingland.com/online-shoppers-use-amazon-to-compare-products-259139\">seven</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/27/amazon-is-the-first-place-most-online-shoppers-visit.html\">nine</a> out of 10 Americans will check Amazon to compare the price of a purchase.) As long as the monopoly doesn’t lead to us forking out more money, then antitrust regulators traditionally leave it alone.</p>\\n<p>However, this view of antitrust leaves out some unique characteristics of digital platforms and marketplaces. These giants don’t just compete on the basis of product quality and price—they control the market through the algorithms and design features that decide which products users will see and be able to choose from. And these choices are not always in consumers’ best interests.</p>\\n<h2>A fresh approach to antitrust</h2>\\n<p>All of the internet giants—Amazon, Google, Facebook, and insofar as app stores are considered, Apple—provide the illusion of free markets, in which billions of consumers choose among millions of suppliers’ offerings, which compete on the basis of price, quality, and availability.</p>\\n<p>But if you recognize that what consumers really choose from is not the universe of all possible products, but those that are offered up to them either on the homepage or the search screen, the “shelf space” provided by these platforms is in fact far more limited than the tiniest of local markets—and what is placed on that shelf is uniquely under the control of the platform owner. And with mobile playing a larger and larger role, that digital shelf space is visibly shrinking rather than growing.</p>\\n<p>In short, the designers of marketplace-platform algorithms and screen layouts can arbitrarily allocate value to whom they choose. The marketplace is designed and controlled by its owners, and that design shapes “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Who-Gets-What-Why-Matchmaking/dp/0544705289\">who gets what and why</a>” (to use the marvelous phrase from Alvin E. Roth, who received a Nobel prize in economics for his foundational work in the field of market design.)</p>\\n\\n<p>When it comes to antitrust, the question of market power must be answered by analyzing the effect of these marketplace designs on both buyers and sellers, and how they change over time. How much of the value goes to the platform, how much to consumers, and how much to suppliers?</p>\\n<p>The platforms have the power to take advantage of either side of their marketplace. Any abuse of market power is likely to show up first on the supply side. A dominant platform can squeeze its suppliers while continuing to pass along part of the benefit to consumers—but keeping more and more of it for themselves.</p>\\n<p>Over time, though, consumers feel the bite. Power over sellers ultimately translates into power over customers as well. As the platform owner favors its own offerings over those of its suppliers, choice is reduced, though it is only in the endgame that consumer pricing—the typical measure of a monopoly—begins to be affected.</p>\\n<p>The control that the platforms have over placement and visibility puts them in a unique position to collect what economists call <em>rents</em>: that is, value extracted through the ownership of a limited resource. These rents may come in the form of additional advantage given to the marketplace’s own private-label products, but also through the fees that are paid by merchants who sell through that platform. These fees can take many forms, including the necessity for merchants to spend more on advertising in order to gain visibility; Amazon products don’t have to pay such a levy.</p>\\n<p>The term “rents” dates back to the very earliest days of modern economics, when agricultural land was still the primary source of wealth. That land was worked productively by tenant farmers, who produced value through their labor. But the bulk of the benefit was taken by the landed gentry, who lived lives of ease on the unearned income that accrued to them simply through the ownership of their vast estates. In today’s parlance, Amazon’s merchants are becoming sharecroppers. The cotton field has been replaced by a search field.</p>\\n<p>Not all rents are bad. Economist Joseph Schumpeter pointed out that technological innovation often can lead to temporary rents, as innovators initially have a corner on a new product or service. But he also pointed out that these so-called Schumpeterian rents can, over time, become traditional monopolistic rents.</p>\\n<p>This is what antitrust regulators should be looking at when evaluating internet platform monopolies. Has control over the algorithms and designs that allocate attention become the latest tool in the landlord’s toolbox?</p>\\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">Big Tech has become the internet’s landlord—and rents are rising as a result.</blockquote>\\n<p>In her book, <a href=\"https://marianamazzucato.com/publications/books/value-of-everything/\"><em>The Value of Everything</em></a>, economist Mariana Mazzucato makes the case that if we are really to understand the sources of inequality in our economy, economists must turn their attention back to rents. One of the central questions of classical economics was what activities are actually creating value for society, and which are merely value extracting—in effect charging a kind of tax on value that has actually been created elsewhere.</p>\\n<p>In today’s neoclassical economics, rents are seen as a temporary aberration, the result of market defects that will disappear given sufficient competition. But whether we are asking fundamental questions about value creation, or merely insufficient competition, rent extraction gives us a new lens through which to consider antitrust policy.</p>\\n<h2>How internet platforms increase choice</h2>\\n<p>Before digital marketplaces curtailed our choices as consumers, they first expanded our options.</p>\\n<p>Amazon’s virtually unlimited virtual shelf space radically expanded opportunity for both suppliers and consumers. After all, <a href=\"https://www.scrapehero.com/number-of-products-on-amazon-april-2019/\">Amazon carries 120 million unique products</a> in the US alone, compared to about 120,000 in a Walmart superstore or 35 million on walmart.com. What’s more, Amazon operates a marketplace with <a href=\"https://www.marketplacepulse.com/amazon/number-of-sellers\">over 2.5 million third-party sellers</a>, whose products, collectively, <a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/2018-letter-to-shareholders\">provide 58% of all Amazon retail revenue</a>, with only 42% coming from Amazon’s first-party retail operation.</p>\\n<p>In the first-party retail operation, Amazon buys products from its suppliers and then resells them to consumers. In the third-party operation, Amazon collects fees for providing marketplace services to sellers—including display on amazon.com, warehousing, shipping, and sometimes even financing—but never legally takes possession of the companies’ merchandise. This is what allows it to have so many more products to sell than its competitors: because Amazon never takes possession of inventory but instead charges suppliers for the services it provides, the risk of offering a slow-moving product is transferred from Amazon to its suppliers.</p>\\n<p>All of this appears to add up to the closest approximation ever seen in retail to what economists call “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition\">perfect competition</a>.” This term refers to market conditions in which a large number of sellers with offers to provide comparable products at a range of prices are met by a large number of buyers looking for those products. Those buyers are armed not only with the ability to compare the price at which products are offered, but also to compare the quality of those products via consumer ratings and reviews. In order to win the business of consumers, suppliers must not only offer the best products at the best prices, but must compete for customers to express their satisfaction with the products they have bought.</p>\\n<p>So far, at least according to the statistics Bezos shared in his annual letter, the success of the Amazon marketplace is a triumph for both suppliers and consumers, and antitrust regulators should look elsewhere. As he put it, “Third-party sellers are kicking our first-party butt.”</p>\\n<p>He may well be right, but there are warning signs from other internet marketplaces like Google search that suggest the situation may not be as rosy as it appears. As it turns out, regulators need to consider some additional factors in order to understand the market power of internet platforms.</p>\\n<h2>How internet platforms take away choice</h2>\\n<p>If Amazon has become “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Store-Jeff-Bezos-Amazon-ebook/dp/B00BWQW73E\">the everything store</a>” for physical goods, Google is the everything store for information.</p>\\n<p>Even more than Amazon, Google appears to meet the conditions for perfect competition. It matches up consumers with a near-infinite source of supply. Ask any question, and you’ll be provided with answers from hundreds or even thousands of competing content suppliers.</p>\\n<p>To do this, Google <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/\">searches hundreds of billions of web pages</a> created by hundreds of millions of information suppliers. Traditional price matching is absent, since much of the content is offered for free, but Google uses hundreds of other signals to determine what answers its customers are likely to find “best.” They measure such things as the reputation of the sites linking to any other site (page rank); the words those sites use to make those links (anchor text); the content of the document itself (via an AI engine referred to as “the Google Brain”); how likely people are to click on a given result in the list, based on millions of iterations, all recorded and measured; and even whether people clicked on a link and appear to have gone away satisfied (“a long click”) or came back and clicked on another (“a short click”).</p>\\n<p>The same goes for advertising on Google. Its <a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/articles/what-is-google-adwords\">“pay per click” ad auction model</a> was a breakthrough in the direction of perfect competition: advertisers pay only when customers click on their ads. Both Google and advertisers are thus incentivized to feature ads that users actually want to see.</p>\\n<p>Only about 6% of Google search results pages contain any advertising at all. Both content producers and consumers have the benefit of Google’s immense effort to index and search all web pages, not just those that are commercially valuable. Google is like a store where all of the goods are free to consumers, but some merchants pay, in the form of advertising, to have their goods placed front and center.</p>\\n<p>The company is well aware of the risk that advertising will lead Google to favor the needs of advertisers over those of searchers. In fact, “Advertising and mixed motives” is the title of the appendix to Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin’s <a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html\">original 1998 research paper on Google’s search algorithms</a>, written while they were still graduate students at Stanford.</p>\\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">By placement on the screen and algorithmic priority, platforms have the power to shape the pages users click on and the products they decide to buy.</blockquote>\\n<p>“The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users,” they thoughtfully observed. Google made enormous efforts to overcome those mixed motives by clearly separating their advertising results from their organic results, but the company has blurred those boundaries over time, perhaps without even recognizing the extent to which they have done so.</p>\\n<p>It is undeniable that the Google search results pages of today look nothing like they did when the company went public in 2004. The list of 10 “organic” results with three paid listings on the top and a sidebar of advertising results on the right that once characterized Google are long gone.</p>\\n<p>Dutch search engine consultant <a href=\"https://www.edwords.nl/2014/04/27/steeds-meer-ruimte-adwords-ten-koste-van-seo/\">Eduard Blacquière documented the changes in size and placement of adwords</a> (link in Dutch), the pay-per-click advertisements that run alongside searches, between 2010 and 2014. Here’s a page he captured in June 2010, the result for a search for the word “autoverzekering” (“auto insurance” in Dutch).</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-32ri8\"><img alt=\"changes in size and placement of adwords\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Tim_1-3aeefcf98cbec1e7ea37b5dc377ba885.jpg\" /><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>Screengrab: Eduard Blacquière.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n<p>Note that the adwords at the top of the page have a background tint, and those at the side have a narrower column width, setting both off clearly from the organic results. Take a quick glance at this page, and your eye can quickly jump to the organic results while ignoring the ads if that’s what you prefer.</p>\\n<p>Here is Blacquière’s dramatization of the change in size of that top block of adwords. As you can see, the ad block has both dramatically changed in size and lost its background color between 2010 and 2019, making it much harder to distinguish ads from organic results.</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-3gKia\"><img alt=\"harder to distinguish ads from organic results\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Tim_2-ad3bed58be86978fd712e233fa30b1ab.jpg\" /><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 2. </span>Screengrab: Eduard Blacquière.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n<p>Today, paid results can push organic results almost off the screen, so that the searcher has to scroll down to see them at all. On mobile pages with advertisements, this is almost always the case. Blacquière also documented the result of several studies done over a five-year period, which found the likelihood of a click on the first organic search result fell from over 40% in 2010 to less than 20% in 2014. This shows that through changes in homepage design alone, Google was able to shift significant attention from organic search results to ads.</p>\\n<p>Not only is paid advertising supplanting organic search results, but for more and more queries, Google itself has now collected enough information to provide what it considers to be the best answer directly to the consumer, eradicating the need to send us to a third-party website at all.</p>\\n<p>That’s the box that often appears above the search results when you ask a question, such as <em>What are the lyrics to “Don’t Stop Believing,”</em> or <em>What date did WWII end?; </em>the box to the right that pops up with restaurant reviews and opening hours; or a series of visual cards midway down the screen that show you the actors who appeared in a movie or different kinds of pastries common to a geographic region.</p>\\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">Through changes in homepage design alone, Google was able to shift significant attention from organic search results to ads.</blockquote>\\n<p>Where does this information come from? In 2010, with <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/deeper-understanding-with-metaweb.html\">the acquisition of Metaweb</a>, Google committed to a project it called “the knowledge graph,” a collection of facts about well-known entities such as places, people, and events. This knowledge graph provides immediate answers for many of the most common queries.</p>\\n<p>The knowledge graph was initially culled from the web by ingesting information from sources such as Wikipedia, Wikidata, and the CIA Factbook, but since then, it has become far more encyclopedic and has ingested information from all over the web. In 2016, Google CEO Sundar Pichai claimed that the Google knowledge graph contained more than 70 billion facts.</p>\\n<p>As shown in the figure below, for a popular search that has commercial potential, like <em>visit Yellowstone</em>, not only is the search results page dominated by paid search results (ads) and content directly supplied by Google, but Google’s “answer boxes” are themselves filled with links to other Google pages rather than to third-party websites. (Note that Google personalizes results and also runs hundreds of thousands of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\">A/B tests</a> a day on the effect of minor changes in position, so your own results for this identical search may have different results than are shown here.)</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-8jiEn\"><img alt=\"google search results\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Tim_3-fb67a3cd5204ae994f4ab9c004966fb4.png\" /><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 3. </span>Screengrab: Tim O\\'Reilly.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n<p>As of March 2017, user clickstream data provided by web analytics firm Jumpshot suggests that <a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/state-of-searcher-behavior-revealed\">up to 40% of all Google queries no longer result in a click through to an external website</a>. Think of all the questions you go to Google for that no longer require a second click: what’s the weather? What’s the current value of the euro against the dollar? What’s that song that’s playing in the background? What’s the best local restaurant? Biographies of eminent people, descriptions of cities, neighborhoods, businesses, historical events, quotes by famous authors, song lyrics, stock prices, and flight times all now appear as immediate answers from Google.</p>\\n<p>I am not necessarily suggesting anti-competitive intent. Google claims, with considerable justice, that all of these changes to search engine result pages are designed to improve user experience. And indeed, it is often helpful to get an immediate answer to a query rather than having to click through to another web site. Furthermore, much of this data is in fact licensed. But these deals seem like a step backward from the perfect competition represented by Google’s original reliance on multi-factor search algorithms to surface the very best information from independent web sites.</p>\\n<p>The net effect on Google’s financial performance is striking. In 2004, the year that Google went public, it had two principal advertising revenue engines: Adwords (those pay-per-click advertisements that run alongside searches on Google’s own site) and Adsense (pay-per-click advertisements that Google places on third-party websites on their behalf, either in search results on their site or directly alongside their content). In 2004, the two revenue sources were very close to equal. But by 2018, Google’s revenue from advertising on its own properties <a href=\"https://qz.com/1540608/the-problem-with-silicon-valleys-obsession-with-blitzscaling-growth/\">had grown to 82% of its total advertising revenue, with only 18% coming from the advertising it provides on third–party sites</a>.</p>\\n<p>These examples illustrate the power of a platform to shape, both by placement on the screen and algorithmic priority, the pages users click on and the products they decide to buy—and therefore also the economic success for the supply side of its marketplace. Google maintains a rigorous separation between the search and advertising teams, but despite that fact, changes in the layout of Google’s pages and its algorithms have played an enormous role in shaping the attention of its users to favor those who advertise with Google.</p>\\n<p>When Google decides unilaterally on the size and position that its own products take on the screen, it also stops consumers from organically deciding what content to click on or what socks to buy. That’s what antitrust regulators should be considering: whether the algorithmic and design control exerted by sites like Google or Amazon reduces the choices we have as consumers.</p>\\n<h2>Maintaining the illusion of choice</h2>\\n<p>If Google has monopolized our access to information, Amazon’s fast-growing advertising business is now shaping what products consumers are actually given to choose from. Have they, too, taken a bite from the poisoned apple of advertising’s mixed motives?</p>\\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">Amazon’s merchants are becoming sharecroppers. The cotton field has been replaced by a search field.</blockquote>\\n<p>Like Google, Amazon used to rely heavily on the collective intelligence of its users to recommend the best products from its suppliers. It did this by using information such as the supplier-provided description of the product, the number and quality of reviews, the number of inbound links, the sales rank of similar products, and so on, to determine the order in which search results would appear. These were all factored into Amazon’s default search ranking, which put products that were considered “Most Popular” first.</p>\\n<p>But as with Google, this eden of internet collective intelligence may be in danger of coming to an end.</p>\\n<p>In the example below, you can see that the default search for “best science fiction books” on Amazon now turns up only “Featured” (i.e., paid for) products. Are these the results you’d expect from this search? Where are the Hugo and Nebula award winners? Where are the books and authors with thousands of five-star reviews?</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-LDibA\"><img alt=\"default search results\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Tim_4-669745af115a715eac3f72debc36432b.png\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n<p>Contrast these results for those for the same search on Google, shown in the figure below. A knowledgeable science-fiction fan might quibble with some of these selections, but this is indeed a list of widely acknowledged classics in the field. In this case, Google presents no advertising, and so the results instead simply reflect the collective intelligence of what the web thinks is best.</p>\\n<p>While this might be taken as a reflection of the superiority of Google’s search algorithms over Amazon’s, the more important point is to note how differently a platform treats results when it has no particular commercial axe to grind.</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-eQiAn\"><img alt=\"how differently a platform treats results when it has no particular commercial axe to grind\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Tim_5-43fd641ca4d9e3970ba558ff5365ce89.png\" /></figure>\\n\\n<p>Amazon has long claimed that the company is <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/greg-satell/the-secret-behind-amazons-uncanny-ability-to-out-innovate-just-about-every-other-company-on-planet.html\">fanatically focused on the needs of its customers</a>. A search like the one shown above, which favors paid results, demonstrates how far the quest for advertising dollars takes them from that avowed goal.</p>\\n<h2>Advice for antitrust regulators</h2>\\n<p>So, how are we therefore best to decide if these Big Tech platforms need to be regulated?</p>\\n<p>In one famous exchange, Bill Gates, the founder and former CEO of Microsoft, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/\">told Chamath Palihapitiya</a>, the one-time head of the Facebook platform:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“This isn’t a platform. A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it exceeds the value of the company that creates it. Then it’s a platform.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Given this understanding of the role of a platform, regulators should be looking to measure whether companies like Amazon or Google are continuing to provide opportunity for their ecosystem of suppliers, or if they’re increasing their own returns at the expense of that ecosystem.</p>\\n<p>Rather than just asking whether consumers benefit in the short term from the companies’ actions, regulators should be looking at the long-term health of the marketplace of suppliers—they are the real source of that consumer benefit, not the platforms alone. Have Amazon, Apple, or Google <em>earned</em> their profits, or are they coming from monopolistic rents?</p>\\n<p>How might we know whether a company operating an algorithmically managed marketplace is extracting rents rather than simply taking a reasonable cut for the services it provides? The first sign may not be that it is raising prices for consumers, but that it is taking a larger percentage from its suppliers, or competing unfairly with them.</p>\\n<p>Before antitrust authorities look to remedies like breaking up these companies, a good first step would be to require disclosure of information about the growth and health of the supply side of their marketplaces. The statistics about the growth of its third-party marketplace that Bezos trumpeted in his shareholder letter tell only half the story. The questions to ask are who profits, by how much, and how that allocation of rewards is changing over time.</p>\\n<p>Regulators such as the SEC should require regular financial reporting on the allocation of value between the platform and its marketplace. I have done limited analysis for Google and Amazon based on information provided in their annual public filings, but much of the information required for a rigorous analysis is just not available.</p>\\n<p>Google provides an annual economic impact report analyzing value provided to its advertisers, but there is no comparable report for the value created for its content suppliers. Nor is there any visibility into the changing fortunes of app suppliers into the Play Store, Google’s Android app marketplace, or into the fortunes of content providers on YouTube.</p>\\n<p>Questions of who gets what and why must be asked of Amazon’s marketplace and its other operating units, <a href=\"https://onezero.medium.com/open-source-betrayed-industry-leaders-accuse-amazon-of-playing-a-rigged-game-with-aws-67177bc748b7\">including its dominant cloud-computing division</a>, or Apple’s App Store. The role of Facebook’s algorithms in deciding what content appears in its readers’ newsfeeds has been widely scrutinized with regard to political bias and manipulation by hostile actors, but there’s been little rigorous economic analysis of <em>economic bias</em> in the algorithms of any of these companies.</p>\\n<p>Data is the currency of these companies. It should also be the currency of those looking to regulate them. You cannot regulate what you don’t understand. The algorithms that these companies use may be defended as trade secrets, but their outcomes should be open to inspection.</p>\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/antitrust-regulators-are-using-the-wrong-tools-to-break-up-big-tech\">Antitrust regulators are using the wrong tools to break up Big Tech.</a></p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/LKjkCKA4W2s\" width=\"1\" />',\n",

Our second would be that they require a shared view of assets and their associated transactions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We then use the following four key blockchain features to further define the benefits of a blockchain-based solution:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Consensus</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>The process of agreeing on new transactions and distributing them to participants in the network.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Provenance</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>A complete history of all transactions related to the assets recorded on the blockchain.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Immutability</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Once a transaction has been stored on the blockchain, it cannot be edited, deleted, or have transactions inserted before it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Finality</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Once a transaction is committed to the blockchain, it is considered “final” and can no longer be “rolled back” or undone.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are several other blockchain benefits that underpin these four key benefits, and are worth keeping in mind as you review any potential scenarios:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Identity</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>All participants in a permissioned blockchain network have an identity in the form of a digital certificate—the same technology that underpins the security and trust when we use a web browser to access our online bank.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Security</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Every transaction in the permissioned network is <em>cryptographically signed</em>, which provides <em>authenticity</em> of which participant sent it, <em>nonrepudiation</em> (meaning they can’t deny sending it), and <em>integrity</em> (meaning it hasn’t been changed since it was sent).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Contracts</strong></p>\\n\\n<p><em>Smart contracts</em> hold the business logic for transactions and are executed across the network by the participants endorsing a transaction.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These benefits help engender trust between the participants in busi‐ ness networks, and we can use them as a litmus test when checking to see if blockchain is a good technology fit. We should note that while it’s not necessary for a scenario to require every benefit just listed, the more that are required, the more the case is strengthened for using blockchain.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We should always be wary of thinking that blockchain is a panacea for all solutions. There are many reasons why blockchain <em>wouldn’t</em> be a good fit. For example:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Blockchain is not suitable if there’s only a single participant in the business network.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Although we talk about transactions and world state databases in blockchain, it shouldn’t be thought of as a replacement for traditional database or transaction servers.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Blockchain by design is a distributed peer-to-peer network, and is heavily based on cryptography. With this comes a number of nonfunctional requirement considerations. For example, performance and latency won’t match a traditional database or transaction server, but scalability, redundancy, and high availability are built in.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Assets, participants, and transactions </h2>\\n\\n<p>When thinking about a potential blockchain solution and the benefits it brings to the network of participants, it is useful to view it in relation to the following concepts:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Assets</li>\\n\\t<li>Participants</li>\\n\\t<li>Transactions</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We have already introduced some examples of these. They are core concepts in a blockchain network that benefit from the four primary trust benefits introduced in the previous section.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Assets </strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Either purely digital, or backed by a physical object, an <em>asset </em>represents something that is recorded on the blockchain. The asset may be shared across the whole network, or can be kept private depending on the requirements. A smart contract defines the asset.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Participants </strong></p>\\n\\n<p><em>Participants </em>occupy different levels in a blockchain network. There are those participants who run parts of the network and endorse transactions. Other members may consume services of the network but may rely on and trust other participants to run the network and endorse transactions. Then there are the end users who are interacting with the blockchain network through a user interface. The end user may not even be aware that a blockchain underpins the system.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Transactions </strong></p>\\n\\n<p>The transactions are coded inside the smart contracts alongside the assets to which the transactions belong. Think of the transactions as the interaction points between the assets and the participants; a participant can create, delete, and update a given asset, assuming they are authorized to do so. It is these transactions that are stored immutably on the blockchain, which also provides the provenance of any changes to the asset over time.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The blockchain fit </strong></p>\\n\\n<p>First and foremost is to check there is a business network in place. Identify how many suppliers and partners are involved in both the internal and external network. If there is a good business network in place, consider the rest of the blockchain features.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As some of the disputes are related to differences between what was ordered and subsequently received, this can often be the result of different participants in a business network (partners, suppliers, and delivery companies) tracking goods in separate siloed systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Therefore, a shared ledger with consensus and finality provided by blockchain across the business network will help to reduce the overall number of disputes as it will give all participants the same information on the assets being tracked.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Furthermore, if changes to the data being tracked either intentionally or unintentionally are part of the root cause of these disputes, then the provenance and immutability features of blockchain could also help.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Last, consider the amount of time taken to resolve these issues. If there are multiple systems (including third-party systems) that someone needs to check in order to resolve any transactions in dispute, having a single shared ledger that is maintained through consensus will help reduce the time taken to resolve them.</p>\\n\\n<p>Some further observations about how a blockchain-based solution can benefit this business network:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Each participant in the business network has an identity and is permissioned in the network. This could help with your processes related to know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML).</li>\\n\\t<li>Smart contracts could be designed to resolve some of the disputes automatically by maintaining consistency across the business network and therefore further reducing the number of disputes.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Choosing a first scenario </strong></p>\\n\\n<p>You may be considering multiple scenarios where blockchain provides a good solution fit. In this case, you will need to compare each to determine which is the best scenario to work on first.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We recommend a simple approach for comparing each scenario using a quadrant chart, where each is placed on the chart based on its relative benefit and simplicity.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In Figure 1, the x-axis is the simplicity of the scenario (simpler to the right) and the y-axis represents the benefit (more beneficial to the top). Place each scenario on the quadrant chart, considering its expected benefit and simplicity as a blockchain solution. This is best done as a group exercise with appropriate stakeholders who can provide the necessary insight to where each scenario falls in the chart based on level of simplicity and potential benefits.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Once all scenarios have been plotted on the chart, it becomes obvious which are the first scenarios to concentrate on—those that will provide the most benefits and are the simplest.</p>\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-YOiex\"><img alt=\"blockchain benefits and scenarios\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/image_1-2-a73a051398ec2b1a4a90eaed951f5320.jpg\" /><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>Comparing scenarios based on their benefit and simplicity</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Transforming the business network</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Once your first blockchain scenario has been identified, you will want to move to the next phase: building the minimal viable product (MVP). An MVP represents the minimum product that can be built to accomplish a goal of the blockchain scenario. Starting an MVP with blockchain shouldn’t be dissimilar to any other technology, and good software engineering practices, such as using Agile principles, will always be applicable. Following are some observations that will help as you start to transform your business with a new blockchain-based solution:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Blockchain is a team sport. There will be multiple stakeholders from different organizations in the business network. Some of these organizations may not have traditionally worked directly with one another. Therefore, a clear understanding of the requirements and issues across all participants, and clear lines of communication and agreement, are critical to the success of the project.</li>\\n\\t<li>Use design thinking techniques that focus on the goals for the user to agree on the scope of the MVP.</li>\\n\\t<li>Use agile software engineering best practices, such as continuous integration and stakeholder feedback, to iterate throughout the development of the MVP. Keep stakeholders informed and act on feedback.</li>\\n\\t<li>Start with a small network and grow. There will be some challenges ahead, as this may be a paradigm shift for the business network.</li>\\n\\t<li>If replacing an existing system, consider running the blockchain-based solution as a shadow chain to mitigate risk. By this we mean, during the pilot phase, run the new platform alongside the legacy system. Ideally, you would pass real production data to the new blockchain-based system to test and validate it, while continuing to rely on the legacy system for this phase of the project. Only after thorough testing has been completed and the new system has been proven should you switch from the legacy system to the new.</li>\\n\\t<li>Although blockchain is likely to be a core foundational part of the solution, it probably won’t be the majority. The blockchain network will still integrate with other external systems, providing additional functions such as off-chain data storage, identity access management, Application Programming Interface (API) management and presentation layers, and so on.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-37934&amp;cm_mmc=Affiliate_OReilly-_-Developer_IBM+Developer-_-WW_WW-_-OReilly+Getting+Started+Enterprise+Blockchain+Ebook_ov70510&amp;cm_mmca1=000019RS&amp;cm_mmca2=10004805\">Read the full free ebook here</a>.</em></p>\\n\\n<p><em>This post is a collaboration between O\\'Reilly and IBM. <a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/about/editorial_independence.html\">See our statement of editorial independence</a>.</em></p>\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/blockchain-solutions-in-enterprise\">Blockchain solutions in enterprise.</a></p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/w-Wv_GFFmpw\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

Voice search, smart speakers, and digital assistants are increasingly prevalent on the consumer side. While far from perfect, the current generation of speech and voice applications work well enough to drive an explosion in voice applications. An early sign of the potential of speech technologies is the growth of <a href=\"https://econsultancy.com/the-future-of-voice-search-2020-and-beyond/\">voice-driven searches</a>: Comscore <a href=\"https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2017/The-Future-of-Voice-From-Smartphones-to-Smart-Speakers-to-Smart-Homes\">estimates</a> that by 2020 about half of all online searches will use voice; <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/insights/articles/gartner-top-5-marketing-predictions-for-2018\">Gartner recommends</a> that companies redesign their websites to support both visual and voice search.

Image source: Yishay Carmiel and Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Audio content is also exploding, and this new content will need to be searched, mined, and unlocked using speech technologies. For example, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/business/media/podcast-growth.html\">recent <em>New York Times</em> article</a>, in the US, “nearly one out of three people listen to at least one podcast every month.” The growth in podcasts isn\\'t limited to the US: podcasts are growing in other parts of the world, <a href=\"https://supchina.com/podcast/learning-to-listen-chinas-billion-dollar-podcast-industry/\">including China</a>.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Voice and conversational applications can be challenging</h2>\\n\\n<p>Unlike text and NLP, or computer vision, where one can pull together simple applications, voice applications—that venture beyond simple voice commands—remain challenging for many organizations. Spoken language tends to be “noisier” than written text. For example, having read many <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/topics/oreilly-data-show-podcast\">podcast</a> transcripts, we can attest that transcripts from spoken conversations still require a lot of editing. Even if you have access to the best <em>transcription</em> (speech-to-text) technology available, you often end up with a document with sentences that contain pauses, fillers, restarts, interjections (in the case of conversations), and ungrammatical constructs. The transcript may also contain passages that need to be refined due to the possibility that someone is “thinking out loud” or had trouble articulating or formulating specific points. Also, the resulting transcript may not be properly punctuated or capitalized in the right places. Thus, in many applications, post-processing of transcripts will require human editors.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In computer vision (and <a href=\"https://thegradient.pub/nlp-imagenet/\">now in NLP</a>), we are at a stage where data has become at least as important as algorithms. Specifically, pre-trained models have achieved the state-of-the art in several tasks in computer vision and NLP. What about for speech? There are a few reasons why a “one size fits all” speech model hasn’t materialized:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>There are a variety of acoustic environments and background noises: indoor or outdoor, in a car, in a warehouse, or in a home, etc.</li>\\n\\t<li>Multiple languages (English, Spanish, Mandarin, etc.) may need to be supported, particularly in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07gyw04\">situations where speakers use</a> (or mix and match) several languages in the course of conversations.</li>\\n\\t<li>The type of application (search, personal assistant, etc.) impacts dialog flow and vocabulary.</li>\\n\\t<li>Depending on the level of sophistication of an application, language models and vocabulary will need to be tuned for specific domains and topics. This is also <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-building-natural-language-processing-systems-in-health-care\">true for text and natural language applications</a>.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Building voice applications</h2>\\n\\n<p>Challenges notwithstanding, as we noted: there is already considerable excitement surrounding speech technologies and voice applications. We haven’t reached the stage where a general-purpose solution can be used to power a wide variety of voice applications, nor do we have voice-enabled <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-next-generation-of-ai-assistants-in-enterprise\">intelligent assistants</a> that can handle multiple domains.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are, however, good building blocks from which one can assemble interesting voice applications. To assist companies that are exploring speech technologies, we assembled the following guidelines:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>Narrow your focus.</strong> As we noted, “one size fits all” is not possible with the current generation of speech technologies, so it is best to focus on specific tasks, languages, and domains.</li>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>Understand the goal of the application, then backtrack to the types of techniques that will be needed.</strong> If you know the <a href=\"https://kpi.org/KPI-Basics\">KPIs</a> for your application, this will let you target the language models needed to achieve those metrics for the specific application domain.</li>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>Experiment with \"real data and real scenarios.”</strong> If you plan to get started by using off-the-shelf models and services, note that it is important to experiment with \"real data and real scenarios.” In many cases, your initial test data will not be representative of how users will interact with the system you hope to deploy.</li>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>Acquire labeled examples for each specific task.</strong> For example, recognizing the word “cat” in English and “cat” in Mandarin will require different models and different labeled data.</li>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>Develop a data-acquisition strategy to gather appropriate data.</strong> Make sure you build a system that can learn as it gathers more data, and an iterative process that fosters ongoing improvement.</li>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>Users of speech applications are concerned about outcomes.</strong> Speech models are only as interesting as the insights that can be derived and the actions that are taken using those insights. For example, if a user asks a smart speaker to play a specific song, the only thing that matters to this user is that it plays that exact song.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6QZiw\"><img alt=\"WIPO AI patent applications\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure3-49a3e9a7d18125511dab462b4bc98f64.png\" /><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 3. </span>Models should be used to derive insights.

Ideally, the needed lexicon and speech models can be updated without much intervention (from machine learning or speech technology experts).</li>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>Voice applications are complex end-to-end systems, so optimize when possible.</strong> Speech <em>recognition</em> systems alone are comprised of several building blocks which we described in <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/deep-learning-revolutionizes-conversational-ai\">a previous post</a>. Training and retraining models can be expensive.

The past 12 months have seen rapid progress in pre-trained natural language models that set records across multiple NLP benchmarks. Developers are beginning to take these language models and tune them for <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-building-natural-language-processing-systems-in-health-care\">specific domains</a> and applications.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Speech adds another level of complexity—beyond <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_understanding\">natural language understanding (NLU)</a>—to AI applications. Spoken language understanding (SLU) requires the ability to <em>extract meaning from speech utterances</em>. While SLU is not yet on hand for voice or speech applications, the good news is that one can already build simple, narrowly focused voice applications using existing models. To find the right use cases, companies will need to understand the limitations of current technologies and algorithms.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the meantime, we\\'ll proceed in stages. As Alan Nichol noted in a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-next-generation-of-ai-assistants-in-enterprise\">post</a> focused on text-based applications, “Chatbots are just the first step in the journey to achieve true AI assistants and autonomous organizations.” In the same way, today’s voice applications provide a very early glimpse of what is to come.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Related content</strong>:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>\\n<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-eu/public/schedule/detail/78072\">“Text analytics 101: Deep learning and attention networks all the way to production”</a>: a new tutorial session at <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-eu\">the Artificial Intelligence Conference in London</a>\\n</li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/deep-learning-revolutionizes-conversational-ai\">“Deep learning revolutionizes conversational AI”</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-next-generation-of-ai-assistants-in-enterprise\">“The next generation of AI assistants in enterprise”</a></li>\\n\\t<li>Yishay Carmiel: <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/commercial-speech-recognition-systems-in-the-age-of-big-data-and-deep-learning\">“Commercial speech recognition systems in the age of big data and deep learning”</a>\\n</li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-building-natural-language-processing-systems-in-health-care\">“Lessons learned building natural language processing systems in health care”</a></li>\\n\\t<li>Alan Nichol: <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/using-machine-learning-to-improve-dialog-flow-in-conversational-applications\">“Using machine learning to improve dialog flow in conversational applications”</a>\\n</li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/one-simple-chart-who-is-interested-in-spark-nlp\">“One simple chart: Who is interested in Spark NLP?”</a></li>\\n\\t<li>Ihab Ilyas and Ben Lorica: <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-quest-for-high-quality-data\">“The quest for high-quality data”</a>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/got-speech-these-guidelines-will-help-you-get-started-building-voice-applications\">Got speech?

Developers are beginning to take these language models and tune them for <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-building-natural-language-processing-systems-in-health-care\">specific domains</a> and applications.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Speech adds another level of complexity—beyond <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_understanding\">natural language understanding (NLU)</a>—to AI applications. Spoken language understanding (SLU) requires the ability to <em>extract meaning from speech utterances</em>. While SLU is not yet on hand for voice or speech applications, the good news is that one can already build simple, narrowly focused voice applications using existing models. To find the right use cases, companies will need to understand the limitations of current technologies and algorithms.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the meantime, we\\'ll proceed in stages. As Alan Nichol noted in a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-next-generation-of-ai-assistants-in-enterprise\">post</a> focused on text-based applications, “Chatbots are just the first step in the journey to achieve true AI assistants and autonomous organizations.” In the same way, today’s voice applications provide a very early glimpse of what is to come.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Related content</strong>:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>\\n<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-eu/public/schedule/detail/78072\">“Text analytics 101: Deep learning and attention networks all the way to production”</a>: a new tutorial session at <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-eu\">the Artificial Intelligence Conference in London</a>\\n</li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/deep-learning-revolutionizes-conversational-ai\">“Deep learning revolutionizes conversational AI”</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-next-generation-of-ai-assistants-in-enterprise\">“The next generation of AI assistants in enterprise”</a></li>\\n\\t<li>Yishay Carmiel: <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/commercial-speech-recognition-systems-in-the-age-of-big-data-and-deep-learning\">“Commercial speech recognition systems in the age of big data and deep learning”</a>\\n</li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-building-natural-language-processing-systems-in-health-care\">“Lessons learned building natural language processing systems in health care”</a></li>\\n\\t<li>Alan Nichol: <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/using-machine-learning-to-improve-dialog-flow-in-conversational-applications\">“Using machine learning to improve dialog flow in conversational applications”</a>\\n</li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/one-simple-chart-who-is-interested-in-spark-nlp\">“One simple chart: Who is interested in Spark NLP?”</a></li>\\n\\t<li>Ihab Ilyas and Ben Lorica: <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-quest-for-high-quality-data\">“The quest for high-quality data”</a>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/got-speech-these-guidelines-will-help-you-get-started-building-voice-applications\">Got speech?

In a review of nearly 7,000 surgical procedures performed at five NHS hospitals, they found that the checklist was used in 97% of cases, but was completed only 62% of the time. When the researchers watched a smaller number of procedures in person, they found that practitioners often failed to give the checks their full attention, and read only two-thirds of the items out loud. In slightly more than 40% of cases, at least one team member was absent during the checks; 10% of the time, the lead surgeon was missing.</i> If you give a checklist that ensures X to workers who don\\'t value X, you get workers who half-arse their way through a checklist. And, in this case, unnecessarily hurt and/or killed patients.</li>\\n\\t<li>\\n<a href=\"http://museumtwo.blogspot.com/2019/08/rowboats-and-magic-feathers-reflections.html\">Rowboats and Magic Feathers: Reflections on 13 Years of Museum 2.0</a> (Nina Simon) -- popular social media productions twist the creators\\' perceptions and become burdens. <i>I kept to a rigorous schedule and never took a week off. Even weeks when I was giving birth, on vacation, or exhausted from challenges at work, I blogged. My attitude was, \"readers don\\'t care what\\'s going on with me. They want the content.\" This blog became like Dumbo\\'s feather. I loved it, but I also let it overpower my sense of self. As long as I was holding it—as long as I was pumping out content—I could soar. But I was terrified to let it drop. Without the blog, I presumed I could not fly.</i> Compare <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUfEfCSQBts&amp;t=1474s\">Overly-Attached Girlfriend\\'s video</a> on leaving YouTube.

In particular, as the degree of temporal correlations increases, the difference in complexity between the wakeful and anaesthetized states becomes larger.</i> Uses an \"epsilon machine,\" which I\\'d not heard of before but which is a \"minimal, unifilar presentation of a stationary stochastic process\" (particular type of hidden Markov model).

In a review of nearly 7,000 surgical procedures performed at five NHS hospitals, they found that the checklist was used in 97% of cases, but was completed only 62% of the time. When the researchers watched a smaller number of procedures in person, they found that practitioners often failed to give the checks their full attention, and read only two-thirds of the items out loud. In slightly more than 40% of cases, at least one team member was absent during the checks; 10% of the time, the lead surgeon was missing.</i> If you give a checklist that ensures X to workers who don\\'t value X, you get workers who half-arse their way through a checklist. And, in this case, unnecessarily hurt and/or killed patients.</li>\\n\\t<li>\\n<a href=\"http://museumtwo.blogspot.com/2019/08/rowboats-and-magic-feathers-reflections.html\">Rowboats and Magic Feathers: Reflections on 13 Years of Museum 2.0</a> (Nina Simon) -- popular social media productions twist the creators\\' perceptions and become burdens. <i>I kept to a rigorous schedule and never took a week off. Even weeks when I was giving birth, on vacation, or exhausted from challenges at work, I blogged. My attitude was, \"readers don\\'t care what\\'s going on with me. They want the content.\" This blog became like Dumbo\\'s feather. I loved it, but I also let it overpower my sense of self. As long as I was holding it—as long as I was pumping out content—I could soar. But I was terrified to let it drop. Without the blog, I presumed I could not fly.</i> Compare <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUfEfCSQBts&amp;t=1474s\">Overly-Attached Girlfriend\\'s video</a> on leaving YouTube.

In particular, as the degree of temporal correlations increases, the difference in complexity between the wakeful and anaesthetized states becomes larger.</i> Uses an \"epsilon machine,\" which I\\'d not heard of before but which is a \"minimal, unifilar presentation of a stationary stochastic process\" (particular type of hidden Markov model). The entropy of the epsilon machine\\'s states yields a measure of statistical complexity, which this paper shows maps to sedated/wake states.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/four-short-links-7-august-2019\">Four short links: 7 August 2019.</a></p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/2B_8Xmkz7Bg\" width=\"1\" />',\n",

If you’re involved with machine learning, you’ve probably seen a number of these images already, in addition to others.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\\'s important to realize that machine learning makes mistakes. Not only does it make mistakes, it always will make mistakes; unlike traditional programming, it\\'s impossible for any ML system to be perfect. I’ve called that “<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-machine-learning-paradox\">the paradox of machine learning</a>.” And that fact requires us to treat ML with a certain amount of caution.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But we need to remember three other things:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>Humans make mistakes, too. It\\'s easy to look at a picture of a mushroom and say \"that\\'s so obviously not a nail.\" But all of us have been fooled at one time or another—possibly many times—about some visual object. And some of those ML misidentifications are mistakes I\\'d make. Find a picture of the harvestman (daddy longlegs) and see if you think it doesn\\'t look like a ladybug. Or if you could blame anyone for misidentifying the squirrel hidden in the grass as a frog. It\\'s important to approach ML\\'s limitations with at least some humility.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>ML mistakes are often completely different from human mistakes. When ML is wrong, it’s “really” wrong—really? Or do ML mistakes seem outlandish only because they’re different from the ones we’d make? ML mistakes often occur because systems lack context. When humans see a picture, we usually know what we’re supposed to look at. ML systems often mistake the background for the thing itself, so a bird feeder is identified as a bird, even if there isn’t a bird on it. Humans are very good at ignoring extraneous information.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>Humans are good at correcting mistakes. This is perhaps where ML systems and humans are most different. ML systems have trouble saying, \"I don\\'t know.\" More than that, they can\\'t say, \"Oh, I see, that really isn\\'t a nail; it\\'s a mushroom.\" They rarely get second chances.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The last point bears some thought. I don\\'t see why software can\\'t admit it made a mistake, particularly if it has a live video feed rather than a static image. As a system looks at something from different perspectives, it should be possible to say \"that thing I thought was a nail, it\\'s really a mushroom.\" It\\'s possible there are already systems that do this; the ability to correct mistaken judgements would be essential for an autonomous vehicle.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That ability is also essential for collaboration between humans and machine learning systems. Collaboration isn\\'t possible when one member of the team (or both) is an oracle that is never wrong, or can never admit it is wrong. When a system only presents a single answer that can\\'t be discussed, humans respond predictably. If they agree with the machine, the machine is useless because it didn\\'t tell them anything they didn\\'t already know. If they disagree, the machine is just wrong. And if the human decides what course of action to take (for example, a patient\\'s diagnosis and treatment), no one may ever find out whether the machine was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Part of the solution is exposing other possibilities: if the machine is classifying images, what classifications had high probabilities but were rejected? A machine might get bonus points for saying \"why.\" Explainability may never be one of ML\\'s strengths, but even neural networks can build a list of alternatives weighted by probabilities. How do we build an interface that exposes these alternatives and lets a human evaluate them? What kind of interface would let a human hold a discussion with an AI? An argument? I don\\'t mean a silly chatbot, like Siri; I mean a reasoned discussion about a situation that demands a decision. What would it mean for a human to convince a machine learning system that it’s wrong?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adversarial images aren’t a problem; they’re an opportunity—and not just an opportunity to fix our classifiers. They’re an opportunity to explore new ways of interacting with AI. We need to move beyond the interfaces and experiences that have informed desktop apps, web apps, and mobile apps. We need to design for collaboration between machines and humans. That\\'s the big challenge facing AI designers.</p>\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/learning-from-adversaries\">Learning from adversaries.</a></p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/0IbfD-U4WTI\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

If you’re involved with machine learning, you’ve probably seen a number of these images already, in addition to others.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\\'s important to realize that machine learning makes mistakes. Not only does it make mistakes, it always will make mistakes; unlike traditional programming, it\\'s impossible for any ML system to be perfect. I’ve called that “<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-machine-learning-paradox\">the paradox of machine learning</a>.” And that fact requires us to treat ML with a certain amount of caution.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But we need to remember three other things:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>Humans make mistakes, too. It\\'s easy to look at a picture of a mushroom and say \"that\\'s so obviously not a nail.\" But all of us have been fooled at one time or another—possibly many times—about some visual object. And some of those ML misidentifications are mistakes I\\'d make. Find a picture of the harvestman (daddy longlegs) and see if you think it doesn\\'t look like a ladybug. Or if you could blame anyone for misidentifying the squirrel hidden in the grass as a frog. It\\'s important to approach ML\\'s limitations with at least some humility.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>ML mistakes are often completely different from human mistakes. When ML is wrong, it’s “really” wrong—really? Or do ML mistakes seem outlandish only because they’re different from the ones we’d make? ML mistakes often occur because systems lack context. When humans see a picture, we usually know what we’re supposed to look at. ML systems often mistake the background for the thing itself, so a bird feeder is identified as a bird, even if there isn’t a bird on it. Humans are very good at ignoring extraneous information.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>Humans are good at correcting mistakes. This is perhaps where ML systems and humans are most different. ML systems have trouble saying, \"I don\\'t know.\" More than that, they can\\'t say, \"Oh, I see, that really isn\\'t a nail; it\\'s a mushroom.\" They rarely get second chances.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The last point bears some thought. I don\\'t see why software can\\'t admit it made a mistake, particularly if it has a live video feed rather than a static image. As a system looks at something from different perspectives, it should be possible to say \"that thing I thought was a nail, it\\'s really a mushroom.\" It\\'s possible there are already systems that do this; the ability to correct mistaken judgements would be essential for an autonomous vehicle.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That ability is also essential for collaboration between humans and machine learning systems. Collaboration isn\\'t possible when one member of the team (or both) is an oracle that is never wrong, or can never admit it is wrong. When a system only presents a single answer that can\\'t be discussed, humans respond predictably. If they agree with the machine, the machine is useless because it didn\\'t tell them anything they didn\\'t already know. If they disagree, the machine is just wrong. And if the human decides what course of action to take (for example, a patient\\'s diagnosis and treatment), no one may ever find out whether the machine was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Part of the solution is exposing other possibilities: if the machine is classifying images, what classifications had high probabilities but were rejected? A machine might get bonus points for saying \"why.\" Explainability may never be one of ML\\'s strengths, but even neural networks can build a list of alternatives weighted by probabilities. How do we build an interface that exposes these alternatives and lets a human evaluate them? What kind of interface would let a human hold a discussion with an AI? An argument? I don\\'t mean a silly chatbot, like Siri; I mean a reasoned discussion about a situation that demands a decision. What would it mean for a human to convince a machine learning system that it’s wrong?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adversarial images aren’t a problem; they’re an opportunity—and not just an opportunity to fix our classifiers. They’re an opportunity to explore new ways of interacting with AI. We need to move beyond the interfaces and experiences that have informed desktop apps, web apps, and mobile apps. We need to design for collaboration between machines and humans. That\\'s the big challenge facing AI designers.</p>\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/learning-from-adversaries\">Learning from adversaries.</a></p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/0IbfD-U4WTI\" width=\"1\" />',\n",

In this post, we\\'ll address this question through the lens of one highly regulated industry: financial services. Financial services firms have a rich tradition of being early adopters of many new technologies, and AI is no exception:</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6YOix\"><img alt=\"Stage of adoption of AI technologies\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure1-4498eaf55b7905f15ae962b3d63d54ae.png\" /><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp\">Stage of adoption of AI technologies</a> (by industry).

The goal of SR 11-7 was to broaden a set of earlier guidelines which focused mainly on model validation. While there aren’t any surprising things in SR 11-7, it pulls together important considerations that arise once an organization starts using models to power important products and services. In the remainder of this post, we\\'ll list the key areas and recommendations covered in SR 11-7, and explain how they are relevant to recent developments in machine learning. (Note that the emphasis of SR 11-7 is on <em>risk management</em>.)</p>\\n\\n<h2>Sources of model risk</h2>\\n\\n<p>We should clarify that SR 11-7 also covers models that aren’t necessarily based on machine learning: \"quantitative method, system, or approach that applies statistical, economic, financial, or mathematical theories, techniques, and assumptions to process input data into quantitative estimates.\" With this in mind, there are many potential sources of model risk, SR 11-7 highlighted incorrect or inappropriate use of models, and fundamental errors. Machine learning developers are beginning to look at an even broader set of risk factors. In <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning\">earlier posts</a>, we listed things ML engineers and data scientists may have to manage, such as bias, privacy, security (including <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/you-created-a-machine-learning-application-now-make-sure-its-secure\">attacks aimed against models</a>), explainability, and <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/assessing-progress-in-automation-technologies\">safety and reliability</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-5meiz\"><img alt=\"Model risk management\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure3_2-fe131cc4a1a96995987b4b609f77eef3.png\" /><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 3. </span>Model risk management. Image by Ben Lorica and Harish Doddi.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Model development and implementation</h2>\\n\\n<p>The authors of SR 11-7 emphasize the importance of having a clear statement of purpose so models are aligned with their intended use. This is consistent with something ML developers have long known: models built and trained for a specific application are <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-building-natural-language-processing-systems-in-health-care\">seldom (off-the-shelf) usable</a> in other settings. Regulators behind SR 11-7 also emphasize the importance of data—specifically data <em>quality</em>, <em>relevance</em>, and <em>documentation</em>. While models garner the most press coverage, the reality is that <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp\">data remains the main bottleneck</a> in most ML projects. With these important considerations in mind, research organizations and startups are building tools focused on data <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-quest-for-high-quality-data\">quality</a>, <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/becoming-a-machine-learning-company-means-investing-in-foundational-technologies\">governance, and lineage</a>. Developers are also building tools that enable model reproducibility, collaboration, and <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/deep-automation-in-machine-learning\">partial automation</a>.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Model validation</h2>\\n\\n<p>SR 11-7 has some specific organizational suggestions for how to approach model validation. The fundamental principle it advances is that organizations need to enable critical analysis by competent teams that are able to identify the limitations of proposed models. First, model validation teams should be comprised of people who weren’t responsible for the development of a model. This is similar to recommendations made in <a href=\"https://www.immuta.com/beyond-explainability-a-practical-guide-to-managing-risk-in-machine-learning-models/\">a recent report</a> released by The Future of Privacy Forum and Immuta (their report is specifically focused on ML). Second, given the tendency to showcase and reward the work of model builders <em>over</em> those of model validators, appropriate authority, incentives, and compensation policies should be in place to reward teams that perform model validation. In particular, SR 11-7 introduces the notion of \"effective challenge\":</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>Staff conducting validation work should have explicit authority to challenge developers and users, and to elevate their findings, including issues and deficiencies. ... Effective challenge depends on a combination of incentives, competence, and influence.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Finally, SR 11-7 recommends that there be processes in place to select and validate models developed by third-parties. Given the rise of SaaS and the proliferation of open source research prototypes, this is an issue that is very relevant to organizations that use machine learning.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Model monitoring</h2>\\n\\n<p>Once a model is deployed to production, SR 11-7 authors emphasize the importance of having monitoring tools and targeted reports aimed at decision-makers. This is in line with <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-are-model-governance-and-model-operations\">our recent recommendation</a> that ML operations teams provide dashboards with custom views for all principals (operations, ML engineers, data scientists, and business owners). They also cite another important reason to setup <em>independent</em> risk monitoring teams: the authors point out that in some instances, the incentive to challenge specific models might be asymmetric. Depending on the reward structure within an organization, some parties might be less likely to challenge models that help elevate their own specific key performance indicators (KPIs).</p>\\n\\n<h2>Governance, policies, controls</h2>\\n\\n<p>SR 11-7 highlights the importance of maintaining a model catalog that contains complete information for all models, including those currently deployed, recently retired, and under development. The authors also emphasize that documentation should be detailed enough so that “parties unfamiliar with a model can understand how the model operates, its limitations, and its key assumptions.” These are relevant to ML, and the early tools and open source projects <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/specialized-tools-for-machine-learning-development-and-model-governance-are-becoming-essential\">for ML lifecycle development and model governance</a> will need to be supplemented with tools that facilitate the creation of adequate documentation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This section of SR 11-7 also has specific recommendations on roles that might be useful for organizations that are beginning to use more ML in products and services:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>Model owners</strong> make sure that models are properly developed, implemented, and used. In the ML world, these are data scientists, machine learning engineers, or other specialists.</li>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>Risk-control staff</strong> take care of risk measurement, limits, monitoring, and independent validation. In the ML context, this would be a separate team of domain experts, data scientists, and ML engineers.</li>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>Compliance staff</strong> ensure there are specific processes in place for model owners and risk-control staff.</li>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>External regulators</strong> are responsible for making sure these measures are being properly followed across all the business units.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h2>Aggregate exposure</h2>\\n\\n<p>There have been many examples of seemingly well-prepared financial institutions caught off-guard by rogue units or rogue traders who weren’t properly accounted for in risk models. To that end, SR 11-7 recommends that financial institutions consider risk from <em>individual</em> models as well as <em>aggregate</em> risks that stem from model interactions and dependencies. Many ML teams have not started to think of tools and processes for managing risks stemming from the simultaneous deployment of multiple models, but it’s clear that many applications will require this sort of planning and thinking. Creators of emerging applications that depend on many different data sources, pipelines, and models (e.g., autonomous vehicles, smart buildings, and smart cities) will need to manage risks in the aggregate. New digital-native companies (in media, e-commerce, finance, etc.) that rely very heavily on data and machine learning also need systems to <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-artificial-intelligence/9781492025894/video323441.html\">monitor many machine learning models individually and in aggregate</a>.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Health care and other industries</h2>\\n\\n<p>While we focused this post in guidelines written specifically for financial institutions, companies in every industry will need to develop tools and processes for model risk management. Many companies are already affected by existing (<a href=\"https://eugdpr.org/\">GDPR</a>) and forthcoming (<a href=\"https://www.caprivacy.org/\">CCPA</a>) privacy regulations. And, as mentioned, ML teams are beginning to build tools to help detect bias, protect privacy, protect against <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/you-created-a-machine-learning-application-now-make-sure-its-secure\">attacks aimed at models</a>, and ensure model <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/assessing-progress-in-automation-technologies\">safety and reliability</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Health care is another highly regulated industry that AI is rapidly changing. Earlier this year, the U.S. FDA took a big step forward by publishing a <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/122535/download\">Proposed Regulatory Framework for Modifications to AI/ML Based Software as a Medical Device</a>. The document starts by stating that “the traditional paradigm of medical device regulation was not designed for adaptive AI/ML technologies, which have the potential to adapt and optimize device performance in real time to continuously improve health care for patients.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The document goes on to propose a framework for risk management and best practices for evolving such ML/AI based systems. As a first step, the authors list modifications that impact users and thus need to be managed:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>modifications to analytical performance (i.e., model re-training)</li>\\n\\t<li>changes to the software’s inputs</li>\\n\\t<li>changes to its intended use.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>The FDA proposes a total product lifecycle approach that requires different regulatory approvals. For the initial system, a premarket assurance of safety and effectiveness is required. For real-time performance, monitoring is required—along with logging, tracking, and other processes supporting a culture of quality—but not regulatory approval of every change.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This regulatory framework is new and was published in order to receive comments from the public before a full implementation. It still lacks requirements for localized measurement of safety and effectiveness, as well as for the evaluation and elimination of bias. However, it’s an important first step for developing a fast-growing AI industry for health care and biotech with a clear regulatory framework, and we recommend that practitioners stay educated on it as it evolves.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Summary</h2>\\n\\n<p>Every important new wave of technologies brings benefits and challenges. Managing risks in machine learning is something organizations will increasingly need to grapple with. SR 11-7 from the Federal Reserve contains many recommendations and guidelines that map well over to the needs of companies that are integrating machine learning into products and services.</p>\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Related content</strong>:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning\">“Managing risk in machine learning”</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-are-model-governance-and-model-operations\">“What are model governance and model operations?”</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/becoming-a-machine-learning-company-means-investing-in-foundational-technologies\">“Becoming a machine learning company means investing in foundational technologies”</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-quest-for-high-quality-data\">“The quest for high-quality data”</a></li>\\n\\t<li>Andrew Burt and Steven Touw on <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning-models\">how companies can manage models they cannot fully explain</a>.</li>\\n\\t<li>David Talby: <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-turning-machine-learning-models-into-real-products-and-services\">“Lessons learned turning machine learning models into real products and services”</a>\\n</li>\\n\\t<li>Ira Cohen: <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/the-artificial-intelligence/9781492025894/9781492025894-video323441\">“Applying machine learning for insights into machine learning algorithms”</a>\\n</li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/you-created-a-machine-learning-application-now-make-sure-its-secure\">“You created a machine learning application.

The authors also emphasize that documentation should be detailed enough so that “parties unfamiliar with a model can understand how the model operates, its limitations, and its key assumptions.” These are relevant to ML, and the early tools and open source projects <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/specialized-tools-for-machine-learning-development-and-model-governance-are-becoming-essential\">for ML lifecycle development and model governance</a> will need to be supplemented with tools that facilitate the creation of adequate documentation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This section of SR 11-7 also has specific recommendations on roles that might be useful for organizations that are beginning to use more ML in products and services:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>Model owners</strong> make sure that models are properly developed, implemented, and used. In the ML world, these are data scientists, machine learning engineers, or other specialists.</li>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>Risk-control staff</strong> take care of risk measurement, limits, monitoring, and independent validation. In the ML context, this would be a separate team of domain experts, data scientists, and ML engineers.</li>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>Compliance staff</strong> ensure there are specific processes in place for model owners and risk-control staff.</li>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>External regulators</strong> are responsible for making sure these measures are being properly followed across all the business units.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h2>Aggregate exposure</h2>\\n\\n<p>There have been many examples of seemingly well-prepared financial institutions caught off-guard by rogue units or rogue traders who weren’t properly accounted for in risk models. To that end, SR 11-7 recommends that financial institutions consider risk from <em>individual</em> models as well as <em>aggregate</em> risks that stem from model interactions and dependencies. Many ML teams have not started to think of tools and processes for managing risks stemming from the simultaneous deployment of multiple models, but it’s clear that many applications will require this sort of planning and thinking. Creators of emerging applications that depend on many different data sources, pipelines, and models (e.g., autonomous vehicles, smart buildings, and smart cities) will need to manage risks in the aggregate. New digital-native companies (in media, e-commerce, finance, etc.) that rely very heavily on data and machine learning also need systems to <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-artificial-intelligence/9781492025894/video323441.html\">monitor many machine learning models individually and in aggregate</a>.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Health care and other industries</h2>\\n\\n<p>While we focused this post in guidelines written specifically for financial institutions, companies in every industry will need to develop tools and processes for model risk management. Many companies are already affected by existing (<a href=\"https://eugdpr.org/\">GDPR</a>) and forthcoming (<a href=\"https://www.caprivacy.org/\">CCPA</a>) privacy regulations. And, as mentioned, ML teams are beginning to build tools to help detect bias, protect privacy, protect against <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/you-created-a-machine-learning-application-now-make-sure-its-secure\">attacks aimed at models</a>, and ensure model <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/assessing-progress-in-automation-technologies\">safety and reliability</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Health care is another highly regulated industry that AI is rapidly changing. Earlier this year, the U.S. FDA took a big step forward by publishing a <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/122535/download\">Proposed Regulatory Framework for Modifications to AI/ML Based Software as a Medical Device</a>. The document starts by stating that “the traditional paradigm of medical device regulation was not designed for adaptive AI/ML technologies, which have the potential to adapt and optimize device performance in real time to continuously improve health care for patients.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The document goes on to propose a framework for risk management and best practices for evolving such ML/AI based systems. As a first step, the authors list modifications that impact users and thus need to be managed:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>modifications to analytical performance (i.e., model re-training)</li>\\n\\t<li>changes to the software’s inputs</li>\\n\\t<li>changes to its intended use.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>The FDA proposes a total product lifecycle approach that requires different regulatory approvals. For the initial system, a premarket assurance of safety and effectiveness is required. For real-time performance, monitoring is required—along with logging, tracking, and other processes supporting a culture of quality—but not regulatory approval of every change.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This regulatory framework is new and was published in order to receive comments from the public before a full implementation. It still lacks requirements for localized measurement of safety and effectiveness, as well as for the evaluation and elimination of bias. However, it’s an important first step for developing a fast-growing AI industry for health care and biotech with a clear regulatory framework, and we recommend that practitioners stay educated on it as it evolves.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Summary</h2>\\n\\n<p>Every important new wave of technologies brings benefits and challenges. Managing risks in machine learning is something organizations will increasingly need to grapple with. SR 11-7 from the Federal Reserve contains many recommendations and guidelines that map well over to the needs of companies that are integrating machine learning into products and services.</p>\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Related content</strong>:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning\">“Managing risk in machine learning”</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-are-model-governance-and-model-operations\">“What are model governance and model operations?”</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/becoming-a-machine-learning-company-means-investing-in-foundational-technologies\">“Becoming a machine learning company means investing in foundational technologies”</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-quest-for-high-quality-data\">“The quest for high-quality data”</a></li>\\n\\t<li>Andrew Burt and Steven Touw on <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning-models\">how companies can manage models they cannot fully explain</a>.</li>\\n\\t<li>David Talby: <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-turning-machine-learning-models-into-real-products-and-services\">“Lessons learned turning machine learning models into real products and services”</a>\\n</li>\\n\\t<li>Ira Cohen: <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/the-artificial-intelligence/9781492025894/9781492025894-video323441\">“Applying machine learning for insights into machine learning algorithms”</a>\\n</li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/you-created-a-machine-learning-application-now-make-sure-its-secure\">“You created a machine learning application.

In <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03731.pdf\"><em>Discrimination in the Age of Algorithms</em></a>, Jon Kleinberg, <em>et al.,</em> argue that algorithms, while unfair, can at least be audited rigorously.

People often don’t know why they make a decision, and even when someone attempts an honest explanation, we never know whether there are underlying biases and prejudices they aren\\'t aware of.

Algorithms don\\'t have those underlying and unacknowledged agendas; the agendas are in the training data, hiding in plain sight if we only search for them. We have the tools we need to make AI transparent–not explainable, perhaps, but we can expose bias, whether it’s hiding in the training data or the algorithm itself.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auditing can reveal when an algorithm has reached its limits. Julia Dressel and Hany Farid, <a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/1/eaao5580.full\">studying the COMPAS software</a> for recommending bail and prison sentences, found that it was no more accurate than randomly chosen people at predicting recidivism. Even more striking, they built a simple classifier that matched COMPAS’s accuracy using only two features–the defendant’s age and number of prior convictions–not the 137 features that COMPAS uses. Their interpretation was that there are limits to prediction, beyond which providing a richer set of features doesn’t add any signal. Commenting on this result, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/01/equivant-compas-algorithm/550646/\">Sharad Goel</a> offers a different interpretation, that “judges in the real world have access to far more information than the volunteers...including witness testimonies, statements from attorneys, and more. Paradoxically, that informational overload can lead to worse results by allowing human biases to kick in.” In this interpretation, data overload can enable unfairness in humans. With an algorithm, it’s possible to audit the data and limit the number of features if that’s what it takes to improve accuracy. You can’t do that with humans; you can’t limit their exposure to extraneous data and experiences that may bias them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Understanding the biases that are present in training data isn\\'t easy or simple. As <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03731.pdf\">Kleinberg points out</a>, properly auditing a model would require collecting data about protected classes; it\\'s difficult to tell whether a model shows racial or gender bias without data about race and gender, and we frequently avoid collecting that data. In <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05807v2.pdf\">another paper</a>, Kleinberg and his co-authors show there are many ways to define fairness that are mathematically incompatible with each other. But understanding model bias is possible, and if possible, it should be possible to build AI systems that are at least as fair as humans, if not more fair.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This process is similar to the 19th-century concept of the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutic_circle\">hermeneutic circle</a>.\" A literary text is inseparable from its culture; we can\\'t understand the text without understanding the culture, nor can we understand the culture without understanding the texts it produced. A model is inseparable from the data that was used to train it; but analyzing the output of the model can help us to understand the data, which in turn enables us to better understand the behavior of the model. To philosophers of the 19th century, the hermeneutic circle implies gradually spiraling inward: better historical understanding of the culture that produces the text enables a better understanding of the texts the culture produced, which in turn enables further progress in understanding the culture, and so on. We approach understanding asymptotically.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I’m bringing up this bit of 19th-century intellectual history because the hermeneutic circle is, if nothing else, an attempt to describe a non-trivial iterative process for answering difficult questions. It’s a more subtle and self-reflective process than “fail forward fast” or even gradient descent. And awareness of the process is important. AI won’t bring us an epiphany in which our tools suddenly set aside years of biased and prejudiced history. That’s what we thought when we “moved fast and broke things”: we thought we could non-critically invent ourselves out of a host of social ills. That didn’t happen. If we can get on a path toward doing better, we are doing well. And that path certainly entails a more complex understanding of how to make progress. We shouldn\\'t ask our AI tools to be fair; instead, we should ask them to be less unfair and be willing to iterate until we see improvement. If we can make progress through several possibly painful iterations, we approach the center.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The hermeneutic circle also reminds us that understanding comes from looking at both the particular and the general: the text and the context. That is particularly important when we’re dealing with data and with AI. It is very easy for human subjects to become abstractions–rows in a database that are assigned a score, like the probability of committing a crime. When we don’t resist that temptation, when we allow ourselves to be ruled by abstractions rather than remembering our abstractions represent people, we will never be “fair”: we’ve lost track of what fair means. It’s impossible to be fair to a table in a database. Fairness is always about individuals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We\\'re right to be skeptical. First, European thought has been plagued by the notion that European culture is the goal of human history. “Move fast and break things” is just another version of that delusion: we’re smart, we’re technocrats, we’re the culmination of history, of course we’ll get it right. If our understanding of \"fairness\" degenerates into an affirmation of what we already are, we are in trouble. It\\'s dangerous to put too much faith in our ability to perform audits and develop metrics: it\\'s easy to game the system, and it\\'s easy to trick yourself into believing you\\'ve achieved something you haven\\'t. I’m encouraged, though, by the idea that the hermeneutic circle is a way of getting things right by being slightly less wrong. It’s a framework that demands humility and dialog. For that dialog to work, it must take into account the present and the past, the individual and the collective data, the disenfranchised and the franchised.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Second, we have to avoid turning the process of fairness into a game: a circle where you\\'re endlessly chasing your tail. It\\'s easy to celebrate the process of circling while forgetting that the goal isn\\'t publishing papers and doing experiments. It’s easy to say “we’re not making any progress, and we probably can’t make any progress, but at least our salaries are being paid and we’re doing interesting work.” It’s easy to play the circle game when it can be proven different definitions of fairness are <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05807v2.pdf\">incompatible</a>, or when contemplating the enormous number of dimensions in which one might want to be fair. And we will have to admit that fairness is not an absolute concept that’s graven on stone tablets, but that is fundamentally situational.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It was easy for the humanistic project of interpretation to lose itself in the circle game because it never had tools like audits and metrics. It could never measure whether it was getting closer to its goal, and when you can\\'t measure your progress, it\\'s easy to get lost. But we can measure disenfranchisement, and we can ensure that marginalized people are included in our conversations, so we understand what being \"fair\" means to people who are outside the system. As Cathy O\\'Neil has suggested, we can <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/f/611113/a-new-company-audits-algorithms-to-see-how-biased-they-are/\">perform audits</a> to black-box systems. We can understand fairness will always be <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-problem-with-building-a-fair-system\">elusive and aspirational</a>, and use that knowledge to build appeal and redress into our systems. We can\\'t let the ideal of perfect fairness become an excuse for inaction. We can make incremental progress toward building a world that\\'s better for all of us.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We\\'ll never finish that project, in part because the issues we\\'re tracking will always be changing, and our old problems will mutate to plague us in new ways. We’ll never be done because we will have to deal with messy questions like what “fair” means in any given context, and those contexts will change constantly. But we can make progress: having taken one step, we\\'ll be in a position to see the next.</p>\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-circle-of-fairness\">The circle of fairness.</a></p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/9lfYubY7QdY\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

You can’t do that with humans; you can’t limit their exposure to extraneous data and experiences that may bias them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Understanding the biases that are present in training data isn\\'t easy or simple. As <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03731.pdf\">Kleinberg points out</a>, properly auditing a model would require collecting data about protected classes; it\\'s difficult to tell whether a model shows racial or gender bias without data about race and gender, and we frequently avoid collecting that data. In <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05807v2.pdf\">another paper</a>, Kleinberg and his co-authors show there are many ways to define fairness that are mathematically incompatible with each other. But understanding model bias is possible, and if possible, it should be possible to build AI systems that are at least as fair as humans, if not more fair.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This process is similar to the 19th-century concept of the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutic_circle\">hermeneutic circle</a>.\" A literary text is inseparable from its culture; we can\\'t understand the text without understanding the culture, nor can we understand the culture without understanding the texts it produced. A model is inseparable from the data that was used to train it; but analyzing the output of the model can help us to understand the data, which in turn enables us to better understand the behavior of the model. To philosophers of the 19th century, the hermeneutic circle implies gradually spiraling inward: better historical understanding of the culture that produces the text enables a better understanding of the texts the culture produced, which in turn enables further progress in understanding the culture, and so on. We approach understanding asymptotically.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I’m bringing up this bit of 19th-century intellectual history because the hermeneutic circle is, if nothing else, an attempt to describe a non-trivial iterative process for answering difficult questions. It’s a more subtle and self-reflective process than “fail forward fast” or even gradient descent. And awareness of the process is important. AI won’t bring us an epiphany in which our tools suddenly set aside years of biased and prejudiced history. That’s what we thought when we “moved fast and broke things”: we thought we could non-critically invent ourselves out of a host of social ills. That didn’t happen. If we can get on a path toward doing better, we are doing well. And that path certainly entails a more complex understanding of how to make progress. We shouldn\\'t ask our AI tools to be fair; instead, we should ask them to be less unfair and be willing to iterate until we see improvement. If we can make progress through several possibly painful iterations, we approach the center.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The hermeneutic circle also reminds us that understanding comes from looking at both the particular and the general: the text and the context. That is particularly important when we’re dealing with data and with AI. It is very easy for human subjects to become abstractions–rows in a database that are assigned a score, like the probability of committing a crime. When we don’t resist that temptation, when we allow ourselves to be ruled by abstractions rather than remembering our abstractions represent people, we will never be “fair”: we’ve lost track of what fair means. It’s impossible to be fair to a table in a database. Fairness is always about individuals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We\\'re right to be skeptical. First, European thought has been plagued by the notion that European culture is the goal of human history. “Move fast and break things” is just another version of that delusion: we’re smart, we’re technocrats, we’re the culmination of history, of course we’ll get it right. If our understanding of \"fairness\" degenerates into an affirmation of what we already are, we are in trouble. It\\'s dangerous to put too much faith in our ability to perform audits and develop metrics: it\\'s easy to game the system, and it\\'s easy to trick yourself into believing you\\'ve achieved something you haven\\'t. I’m encouraged, though, by the idea that the hermeneutic circle is a way of getting things right by being slightly less wrong. It’s a framework that demands humility and dialog. For that dialog to work, it must take into account the present and the past, the individual and the collective data, the disenfranchised and the franchised.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Second, we have to avoid turning the process of fairness into a game: a circle where you\\'re endlessly chasing your tail. It\\'s easy to celebrate the process of circling while forgetting that the goal isn\\'t publishing papers and doing experiments. It’s easy to say “we’re not making any progress, and we probably can’t make any progress, but at least our salaries are being paid and we’re doing interesting work.” It’s easy to play the circle game when it can be proven different definitions of fairness are <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05807v2.pdf\">incompatible</a>, or when contemplating the enormous number of dimensions in which one might want to be fair. And we will have to admit that fairness is not an absolute concept that’s graven on stone tablets, but that is fundamentally situational.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It was easy for the humanistic project of interpretation to lose itself in the circle game because it never had tools like audits and metrics. It could never measure whether it was getting closer to its goal, and when you can\\'t measure your progress, it\\'s easy to get lost. But we can measure disenfranchisement, and we can ensure that marginalized people are included in our conversations, so we understand what being \"fair\" means to people who are outside the system. As Cathy O\\'Neil has suggested, we can <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/f/611113/a-new-company-audits-algorithms-to-see-how-biased-they-are/\">perform audits</a> to black-box systems. We can understand fairness will always be <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-problem-with-building-a-fair-system\">elusive and aspirational</a>, and use that knowledge to build appeal and redress into our systems. We can\\'t let the ideal of perfect fairness become an excuse for inaction. We can make incremental progress toward building a world that\\'s better for all of us.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We\\'ll never finish that project, in part because the issues we\\'re tracking will always be changing, and our old problems will mutate to plague us in new ways. We’ll never be done because we will have to deal with messy questions like what “fair” means in any given context, and those contexts will change constantly. But we can make progress: having taken one step, we\\'ll be in a position to see the next.</p>\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-circle-of-fairness\">The circle of fairness.</a></p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/9lfYubY7QdY\" width=\"1\" />',\n",
